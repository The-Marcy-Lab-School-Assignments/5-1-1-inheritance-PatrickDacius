# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
The difference between a instance method and a class method is that a class method's are static and with class methods being static we can acess a classes method through that specific class itself. Whereas for a instance method it is not static and we would need to invoke this method in  a newly created object.
