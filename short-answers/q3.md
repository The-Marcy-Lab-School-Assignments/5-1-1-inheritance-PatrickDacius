# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
polymorphism is a object that shares its signatures (same properties or method names), for example if a superClass has a method the child of that superClass can also take on that same method but the functionality would take on the latest one created which is the one of the child. 

example in a code snippet: 

```js 
class SuperHero {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.opponent = [];
  }
  voiceThreat(enemy) {
    this.opponent.push(enemy)
   console.log(`My name is ${this.name}, and im here to defeat ${enemy}!`);  // statement 1 
  }
}

class Villan extends SuperHero{
  
  voiceThreat(enemy) {
    this.opponent.push(enemy);
    console.log(`My name is ${enemy}, and I WILL defeat ${this.name} HAHAHA`);  // statememt 2 
  }
}


// would print out statement 2 due to polymorphism.
